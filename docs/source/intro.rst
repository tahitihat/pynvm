Introduction
===============================================================================
This library provides the unofficial Python bindings for the
`NVM Library <https://github.com/pmem/nvml>`_. The bindings were created
using the Python CFFI package (*C Foreign Function Interface for Python*).

Overview and Rationale
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, there are no Python packages supporting *persistent memory*, where
by *persistent memory* we mean memory that is accessed like volatile memory,
using processor **load and store** instructions but retaining its contents across
power loss just like traditional storages.

The goal of this project is to provide Python bindings for the libraries part
of the `NVM Library <https://github.com/pmem/nvml>`_. The **pynvml** project
aims to create bindings for the NVM Library without modifying the Python
interpreter itself, thus making it compatible to a wide range of Python
interpreters (including PyPy). 

These bindings were created using 
the Python CFFI package (*C Foreign Function Interface for Python*).

.. note :: 
    This **is not** an official port of the NVM Library.

How it works
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   *Image from: http://pmem.io*
   

In the image above, we can see different types of access to a NVDIMM device.
There are the standard and well known types of access like the one using the
standard file API (fopen/open, etc.), and the type of access that we're really
interested which is the one on the right using Load/Store and bypassing the
Kernel space code. This is the shortest kind of access an application can
do to access the memory, and in our case, this is not only a traditional kind
of volatile memory, it is a **persistent memory**, and this is why it is so important,
because you don't need to serialize data to disk anymore, you just need to keep your
data structures in memory, and now this data is also persistent. However with great
powers comes great responsabilities, now it is duty of your application to
provide things such as flushes and hardware drains
(i.e. `CLWB/PCOMMIT instructions <http://danluu.com/clwb-pcommit/>`_), that is
where this framework and Intel's `NVM Library <https://github.com/pmem/nvml>`_
comes in.

Installation and Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install **pynvm**, you'll need to meet some requirements:

    * `NVM Library <https://github.com/pmem/nvml>`_ (install instructions at Github)

After installing the requirements, you'll just need to install the **pynvm** from
the Python PyPI repositories using **pip**::

    pip install pynvm

**pip** will automatically install all dependencies for the Python package and then
you should be able to use the package.

Getting Started
===============================================================================
In this section you'll find tutorials on how to use each library supported by
the **pynvm** framework.

Using pmem (*low level persistent memory*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pmem module exposes a "pythonic" interface to the :mod:`nvm.pmem` API, which
provides low level persistent memory support.

.. seealso:: For more information regarding the **libpmem**, please
             refer to `libpmem manual <http://pmem.io/nvml/libpmem/>`_ or
             to the documentation on the API itself at :mod:`nvm.pmem`.

Opening files, writting and reading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can see an example below on how to use the pmem API:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from nvm import pmem
    from fallocate import posix_fallocate

    # (optional) check the pmem library version
    pmem.check_version(1, 0)

    # Open file to write and fallocate space
    fhandle = open("dst.dat", "w+")
    posix_fallocate(fhandle, 0, 4096)

    # mmap it using pmem
    reg = pmem.map(fhandle, 4096)
    
    # Write on it and seek to position zero
    reg.write("lol" * 10)
    reg.write("aaaa")
    reg.seek(0)

    # Read what was written
    print reg.read(10)
    print reg.read(10)

    # Persist the data into the persistent memory
    # (flush and hardware drain)
    pmem.persist(reg)


Context managers for flush and drain and numpy buffers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also use context managers present in the API like the :class:`~nvm.pmem.FlushContext`
or the :class:`~nvm.pmem.DrainContext`:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import numpy as np
    from nvm import pmem
    from fallocate import posix_fallocate

    fhandle = open("dst.dat", "w+")
    posix_fallocate(fhandle, 0, 4096)

    # Will persist (pmem_persist) and unmap
    # automatically
    with pmem.map(fhandle, 4096) as reg:
        reg.write("lol" * 10)
        reg.write("aaaa")
        
        # This will create a numpy array located at
        # persistent memory (very cool indeed) where you
        # can reshape as you like
        n = np.frombuffer(reg.buffer, dtype=np.int32)
        print n.shape

    # Flush context will only flush processor caches, useful
    # in cases where you want to flush several discontiguous ranges
    # and then run hardware drain only once
    m = pmem.map(fhandle, 4096)
    with pmem.FlushContext(m) as reg:
        reg.write("lol" * 10)
        reg.write("aaaa")

    # Will only execute the hardware drain (aka PCOMMIT)
    m = pmem.map(fhandle, 4096)
    with pmem.DrainContext(m) as reg:
        reg.write("lol" * 10)
        reg.write("aaaa")

    fhandle.close()


Using pmemlog (*pmem-resident log file*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pmemlog module exposes a "pythonic" interface to the :mod:`nvm.pmemlog` API, which
provides pmem-resident log (*append-only*) file memory support.

.. seealso:: For more information regarding the **libpmemlog**, please
             refer to `libpmemlog manual <http://pmem.io/nvml/libpmemlog/>`_ or
             to the documentation on the API itself at :mod:`nvm.pmemlog`.

Creating log pool and appending into it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can see an example below on how to use the :mod:`nvm.pmemlog` API:

.. code-block:: python

    from nvm import pmemlog

    # Create the logging and print the size (default is 2MB when not
    # specified)
    log = pmemlog.create("mylogging.pmemlog")
    print log.nbyte()

    # Append to the log
    log.append("persistent logging!")

    # Walk over the log (you can also specify chunk sizes)
    def take_walk(data):
        print "Data:", data
        return 1

    log.walk(take_walk)
    # This will show: "Data: persistent logging!"

    # Close the log pool
    log.close()


Using pmemblk (*arrays of pmem-resident blocks*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pmemblk module exposes a "pythonic" interface to the :mod:`nvm.pmemblk` API, which
provides arrays of pmem-resident blocks support.

.. seealso:: For more information regarding the **libpmemblk**, please
             refer to `libpmemblk manual <http://pmem.io/nvml/libpmemblk/>`_ or
             to the documentation on the API itself at :mod:`nvm.pmemblk`.

Creating block pool and writing into the blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can see an example below on how to use the :mod:`nvm.pmemblk` API:

.. code-block:: python

    from nvm import pmemblk

    # This will create a block pool with block size of 256 and
    # 1GB pool
    blockpool = pmemblk.create("happy_blocks.pmemblk", 256, 1<<30)

    # Print the number of blocks available
    print blockpool.nblock()

    # Write into the 20th block
    blockpool.write("persistent block!", 20)

    # Read the block 20 back
    data = blockpool.read(20)
    blockpool.close()

    # Reopen the blockpool and print 20th block
    blockpool = pmemblk.open("happy_blocks.pmemblk")
    print blockpool.read(20)

    blockpool.close()


Using pmemobj (*persistent objects*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pmemobj module provides a pythonic interface to :mod:`nvm.pmemobj`, which
provides transactionally managed access to memory that supports mallocing and
freeing memory areas.  In this case, rather than provide a simple wrapper
around the pmemobj API, which by itself isn't very useful from Python, pynvm
provides a full python interface.  This interface allows to you store
Python objects persistently.

This is a work in progress: currently persistence is supported only for lists
(PersistentList), integers, strings, floats, and None.

Creating a PersistentObjectPool and storing objects in it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can see an example below of how to use the :mod:`nvm.pmemobj` API:

.. code-block:: python

    from nvm import pmemobj

    # Open the object pool, creating it if it doesn't exist yet.
    pop = pmemobj.PersistentObjectPool('mylist.pmemobj', flag='c')

    # Use a persistent list as the root object of the pool.
    if pop.root is None:
        pop.root = pop.new(pmemobj.PersistentList)

    # Make sure we have three sub-lists.
    for i in range(len(pop.root), 3):
        pop.root[i] = pop.new(pmemobj.PersistentList)

    # Append some data.  Either all of this data will get appended,
    # or none of it will.
    with pop.transaction():
        for i in range(len(self.root)):
            root[i].append(i)

    # Close and reopen the pool.
    pop.close()
    pop = pmemobj.PersistentObjectPool('mylist.pmemobj', flag='c')

    # The list values are still there.
    assert pop.root == [[1], [2], [3]]
